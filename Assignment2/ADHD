ABSTRACT
Animation based online instructional sessions were organised for enhancing learning attainment and cognitive functioning skills for children
diagnosed with ADHD symptoms. The study aimed to examine the effectiveness of animation-based instruction for the empowerment of learning
attainment in relation to the cognitive functioning in students with ADHD
during COVID-19 crisis. Quasi-experimental design was done on students
with ADHD (n = 75, 11–12 years) from three different schools of Assam,
India. The mean performance of animated cartoon-based instruction and
static cartoon-based instruction was found better over the comparison
group. Moreover, the ANCOVA result reveals a significant effect of animation and static cartoon-based intervention in learning attainment and
cognitive functioning of the participants. Overall, the animation-based
instructional approach was particularly effective in favouring development of memory and reasoning capacity in participants.
Results demonstrated that as the study used small sample size and lacked
proper observation effect, thereby more research is required to come to
conclusion about the application of animation-based intervention at different levels of education.

Introduction
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) compelled for complete and partial lockdown all over the world
including India. All the educational institutions starting from pre-primary section to university level
were closed down and suspended their physical class, and some of the institutions in India even went
for virtual classes. Consequently, it has become difficult for students, particularly the students who
were diagnosed with ADHD syndrome to learn their subject matters, staying at home without doing
any outdoor activities. So, to keep pace with these changes, there was increasing demand for
paradigm shift in pedagogical practices. However, it is observed that over the last few decades,
there are an increasing number of researches investigated the application of technology-based
intervention for various skill developments among students with ADHD (Valtolina and Di Gaetano
2018). These new pedagogical approaches open a new avenue, enhance motivation towards learning,
encourage analytic and synthetic thinking which develops problem-solving skills and critical thinking,
improve social relationship with peers, cultivate moral values and boost self-confidence among them.
However, prior research demonstrated that about 5–10% of children suffered from attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) syndrome showing impairment in focusing attention and remained
hyperactive/impulsive most of the time (Danielson et al. 2018; Wilkes-Gillan, Bundy, Cordier, and

Lincoln 2014). The global pandemic-related experiences may even worsen the ADHD condition,
maladjustment issue, academic disengagement, stress, and anxiety. Moreover, there are enumerable
preset investigations in which students with ADHD showed lower grade performance, high dropout
rate and struggled academically as compared to students without any disabilities (Andreou, Riga, and
Papayiannis 2016; Bolic et al. 2013). In addition, a very recent investigation done by Kouvava et al.
(2021) found that the children who were diagnosed with ADHD symptoms tended to have fewer
friend circle, ability to maintain friendship, poorer understanding and manage emotions and control
their impulsivity and hyperactive behaviour as compared to the non-ADHD children. To till date, the
use of technology-based instruction proved to be very useful in improving children’s cognitive
development (Shah et al. 2020), which is very necessary for their academic and career upliftment.
Similarly, implementation of video games and cartoon-based instruction assists students in minimising their distraction level and improving their attention span (Arunraj and Blessy 2015; Johnson and
Reid 2011) even during the lockdown period. One more recent study done by Mtebe and Twaakyondo
(2012) has also revealed that teaching through animated video motivates students to learn any tough
topic and sustain attention for a particular period of time by seeing the pictures and motion.
Consequently, it helps in developing interest towards learning and develops study habits in students.
Current research indicated that the presence of ADHD symptoms has a significant negative impact on
various dimensions of student’s academic life such as poor social interpersonal skill, psychological
issues, defective time management, deficient communication skills, learning impairments. (Green and
Rabiner 2016; Guan Lim, Lim-Ashworth, and Fung 2020). In addition, ADHD-related neuropsychological deficits have close association with cognitive dysfunction of students such as deficit in paying
attention, poor memory, lower perception and difficulty in concentration (Mary & Scheres 2020;
Mohammed 2016), which negatively impacts their academic achievement. Moreover, several research
have shown that elementary students with ADHD tended to show poorer performance in academic
than the students without ADHD condition (Kuriyan et al. 2013), and the underachievement in
academics may be due to the result of deficit in cognitive development (Jansen et al. 2017). These
findings proved that undeniably cognitive development and academic achievement of ADHD students have significant relationship with each other. So, to cope with the problems of academic
underachievement and dysfunction in cognitive processes, the elementary students with ADHD are
in need of a new approach in teaching, especially during the COVID crisis period which may be
animation-based instructional approach. Animation is considered a form of caricature which represents any contemporary issue, event, political issue and social trend (Mohammed 2016). Several
studies proved that animation -based instruction not only helps in developing reading and thinking
capacity but also enhances concentration, motivation, develop scientific temper and problem-solving
skills among students at all levels of education (Musa et al. 2015). A very recent study’s findings did by
Ugwuanyi et al. (2020) revealed that motivation and performance in academic achievement were
significantly improved among students when they were taught through animation rather than the
non-animated video lecture. Moreover, educational animation in teaching–learning process also can
make the students be more active, keep them engaged or busy and get dynamic experience (Drigas,
Ioannidou, Kokkalia, and Lytras 2014; Gambari, Falode, and Adegbenro 2014). These results indicated
that use of animation has significant positive impact on achievement and behaviour of ADHD
children.
Despite several studies that have been conducted on cartoon, animation and technology in
general as a pedagogical approach for the children without disability in some specific subjects, i.e.
Science (Gambari, Falode, and Adegbenro 2014), Mathematics (Ejimonye, Ugwuanyi, Okeke, and
Nwoye 2020), Economics (Islam et al. 2014), Physics (Ugwuanyi et al. 2020) and Biology (Edo 2017).
However, to this date, there is a lack of evidence reporting the effectiveness of animation-based
approach on learning attainment in Environmental Studies and its relationship with cognitive
development of elementary students with ADHD in India, especially in Assam. So, to address this
gap, the study has been designed with the purposes a) to assess the effectiveness of animationEMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DIFFICULTIES 89
based instructional approach over the conventional method on Environmental Studies learning
achievement and b) to examine relationship between effect of animation-based intervention and
cognitive functioning of elementary students diagnosed with ADHD in Assam, India.
Critical analysis of animation-based instructional approach
In the era of technology-aided education, multimedia, slide share, cartoon, animation, etc., have
great importance in teaching–learning process (Aksoy, 2013), and these visual materials help
students with ADHD to stay focused on particular content. Cartoon or animation plays
a significant role in the technology-based education where the students using their visual sense
try to sustain attention while learning any subject matter (Jena, Bhattacharjee, Devi, and Barman
2020; Riga and Andreou2018). Educational cartoon can be of two types, static or gag cartoon and
animated cartoon. Static cartoon represent graphics, pictures or images attached with caption inside
one or more balloons without visual movement (Kaplan & Ozturk 2015). In other words, in gag or
static cartoon, the caption or balloon appears to be humorous to children. Whereas, animated
cartoon represents the image or graphic with visual movement to demonstrate the process in
action. In this context, animation acts as stimuli on the part of students as it encourages student’s
participation and engagement in teaching–learning process. Therefore, animated videos easily
attract student’s attention and enhances their motivation, interest and self-esteem towards learning
(Aktas, Bulut, and Yuksel 2011). Several prior research emphasised on the use of computer animation
in classroom transaction since it helps to retrieve and retain information for a longer time, which
helps to improve their problem-solving skills, promote scientific outlook and increase academic
performance (Karacop and Doymus 2013; Wang, Vaughn, and Liu 2011). Moreover, in animation, as
both video and audio features are combined together, it not only helps the students to encode
information provided and store it for longer time in memory but also produces it whenever it is
required. This proved that the methods or strategies used by the teachers determine the academic
attainment of students who were diagnosed with ADHD in Environmental Studies subject. So, it is
the need of hour for paradigm shift in adoption of methods that the teacher should apply. Therefore,
the application of cartoon or animation as an educational tool can be used for solving the problem of
poor academic performance in Environmental Studies among students, particularly for those who
have inattention and hyperactive syndrome. Mostly, in western countries, educational animation is
considered as the most innovative, constructive and child-centred strategy as compared to the
traditional approach (Etim, Itighise, and Ema 2016) since it provides dynamic experience for teacher
and students as well. Furthermore, it is also found that animation is far better than the static or gag
cartoon since animation represent images that have motion features rather than only just showing
picture (Rias and Zaman 2011). Besides these, there are numerous evidence that supports animationbased approach as it helps to encode and decode information more than the static cartoon (Jena,
2015; Gambari, Falode, and Adegbenro 2014), which proved that animation is much better than the
static cartoon in terms of their performance and results. Undoubtedly, animation helps not only
students with ADHD to learn the concepts easily and quickly but also the teacher to explain the
complex subject matter, which requires imagination capacity on the part of students. For instance,
there is a topic, ‘Space and spaceship’ in Environmental Studies subject of class V. This topic is
difficult to understand especially for the students with ADHD as they have to imagine about the
concept of space, spaceship, universe, etc. But when this topic was taught with the help of
animation, then they learnt it much faster, easier and felt amusing than the traditional chalk and
talk method. Likewise, Ejimonye et al. (2020) did a study to assess the effect of two-dimensional
animation for improving motivation and academic achievement in mathematical operation of
economics and found that 2D animation strategy has significant positive impact on their motivation,
interest and achievement of children. One more similar study done by Ugwuanyi et al. (2019) found
that the performance in Physics and Mathematics subject improved among primary students, while
they were exposed to animation-based PowerPoint presentation. In the same way, when the
90 J. DEVI AND A. K. JENA
students with ADHD of experimental group were taught through Microsoft PowerPoint strategy,
their grades improved with comparison to the control group who were exposed to solely traditional
method (Anigbo & Orie 2018). Furthermore, the findings of Bamidele and Yoade (2017) revealed that
when animation along with narration and text was exposed to experimental group, it produced
highest score (m = 16.67), then followed by animation with narration only produced 15.42 mean
score and control group possessed least score (m = 12.75) for the traditional method. In contrast,
several research findings revealed that animated cartoon which shows violence and sex content
encourages negative and unacceptable behaviour in children with ADHD (Lillard and Peterson 2011).
In addition, they found that watching too much cartoon may hamper their social development with
their peers and can affect his/her ability in critical thinking capacity. Hence, it is also found from some
recent studies that if the children watched animation too frequently, then they show deficit in
executive functions such as working memory, problem solving, self-control, decision making.
(Hassan and Daniyal 2013). Furthermore, the characters shown in the animation affect the behaviour
of children as they learn things through imitation and perform the activities that they observe and
see in the moving pictures (Cohen, Bryant, and Voderer 2014). Similarly, Hamzat, Bello, and Abimbola
(2017) examined the efficacy of animation-based computer instructional package on Biology subject’s achievement in Nigeria. The study showed that the participants of experimental group got
higher achievement score when they were taught through animation package as compared to the
control group who were only exposed to traditional method without any package. Moreover, Falode
et al. (2016) also did a study on use of animation-based instructional package in teaching Agricultural
Science, which proved that the performance of treatment group was much better than the control
group of lecture method when the same topics were taught. Similarly, an investigation was done by
Islam et al. (2014) in Bangladesh on teaching children with ADHD through animation technique. This
study resulted in the application of computer animation that was very useful and effective in
enhancing learning capacity among students with ADHD. Apart from these, animation allows in
developing multiple skills such as in developing appropriate behaviour, interpersonal skill, communication skill and social development among children endorsed with ADHD.
However, the preset research findings indicated that application of educational technologies is
very useful in improving motivation and achievement among students with ADHD in science, social
science and other subjects. However, till today, no investigation was found that studies the effectiveness of cartoon or animation on academic achievement and cognitive functioning of elementary
students endorsed with ADHD in Environmental Studies, and this gap in literature review necessitated the current study. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic compelled for an urgent paradigm
shift in teaching–learning process at all levels of education starting from elementary to higher
education. Most of the developed countries are generally well equipped with ICT tools in their
classroom transaction, but such facilities are lacking in developing nations like India. Hence, this
research tries to examine animation as an educational tool on the achievement and cognitive
processes of students with ADHD. Therefore, the investigators hypothesised that cartoon or animation has a significant positive impact on achievement and cognitive processes of elementary school
children with ADHD in Environmental Studies.
Methodology
Ethical consideration
Approval from the research ethics committee of Assam University, Silchar, was sought and granted.
The researcher rigorously followed the ethical specification of American Psychiatric Association
(2013). Moreover, the participants, teachers and their parents were informed about objectives and
procedure of this study and completed a written consent form to carry out the investigation.
EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DIFFICULTIES 91
Participants and setting
For conducting the experiment, firstly the researchers identified the symptoms of ADHD in students
of class V from the chosen three different schools affiliated to CBSE board of three different
districts of Assam, India. For identifying the ADHD symptoms, the investigators took help of teachers,
who were teaching the students by administering the ADHD diagnostic teacher rating scale with due
permission and found 84 students having ADHD symptoms. Later, five of them were excluded from
the investigation since they were suffering from other co-morbid disorder and were under treatment. Finally, the researchers identified and found 75 students having ADHD condition for the
experimentation, and they belonged to 11 and 12 years old and free from any kinds of comorbidities. Other information from the participants was not collected as it was not essential for
this investigation. Further, a total of 25 (male = 16, female = 9, age range 10.5–11.5, SD = 11) students
with ADHD of experimental group A were instructed through animation-based instructional
approach, and 25 students with ADHD (male = 13, female = 12, age range 10.5–11.5, SD = 11) of
experimental group B were exposed to static cartoon-based instructional approach, while 25
students of (male = 15, female = 10, age range 10.5–11.5, SD = 11) ADHD comparison group for
conventional discussion method.
The experiment was done during the period when there was partial lockdown in Assam due to
COVID-19 pandemic, and for this reason, the investigators had to continue this study using virtual
mode rather than face-to-face interaction. For this, the researchers consulted with the school
authority concerned for online instruction as the face-to-face class was suspended. Initially, the
investigators took three to four periods of online interaction session with the purpose for familiarisation with the students where there was no topic-wise discussion. After familiarisation with the
class, pre-test on achievement test and cognitive functioning test was administered using Google
forms to all the participants of three groups. After that, the participants were provided interventions
on the contents of Environmental Studies subject for about 20 weeks. After 20 weeks of instruction,
post-tests were administered among the same participants with the same set of tests to assess their
improvement in learning attainment and cognitive functioning.
Design of the study
Pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental designs across the 75 participants were used to assess
effect of animation-based instructional intervention on learning attainment and cognitive functioning of students with ADHD. The study lasted 20 weeks for animation-based instruction phase, static
cartoon-based instruction (SCBI) phase, intervention phase and post-test intervention. With the
multiple interventions, one may see the impact of intervention on the behaviour and learning
achievement of participants only when the intervention was applied.
Procedure of experiment and data collection
The investigators divided the procedure activity into basic three stages, i.e. animation-based instruction, SCBI and conventional approach. The detailed description of stages 1, 2 and 3 are presented
below:
Stage 1: animation-based instructional approach
Animation is a very effective learning technique which helps in not only enhancing learning
attainment but also developing multiple skills such as interpersonal skills, cognitive skills, communication skills and learning performance (Islam et al. 2014). For conducting the experiment, the
researchers with prior permission visited school I and discussed with the principal and teachers
regarding the experiment and its procedures. After finalising the class, the investigators selected the
92 J. DEVI AND A. K. JENA
students with ADHD condition for the further experimentation process. For identifying the syndrome
of ADHD among the students of class V, standardised ADHD diagnostic teachers’ rating scale was
provided to the teachers of school I and randomly assigned for experimental group A and treated
with animation-based instructional intervention. Initially, this group comprised 27 participants, but 2
of them were excluded from the experiment due to other co-morbid conditions. Therefore, the final
sample for this group was 25 participants. Just prior to the actual teaching, the participants were
given for short-term training on animation-based instruction for the familiarisation with the contents
through Google Meet. In due course, the pre-test on achievement test and cognitive functioning was
administered just before the actual intervention with the purpose of assessing their cognitive
abilities and performance in Environmental Studies. After pre-test, they continuously provided
animation-based instructional intervention using animated videos for practices for about 5 months.
Similarly, they were post-tested on the same participants with the same test or questionnaire for
assessing the efficacy of animation-based instructional approach on learning attainment in relation
to their cognitive functioning.
Stage 2: static cartoon-based instructional approach
Static cartoon refers to the images, pictures and graphics that may be attached with captions inside
balloon without visual movement which may be humorous to children (Kaplan & Ozturk 2015).
Cartoon represents a caricature which shows contemporary issue, event or any social trend which
develops reading and cognitive processes (Mohammed 2016). In addition, it helps to improve
concentration level, motivation and problem-solving skills among the students with ADHD (Musa
et al. 2015). In accordance, the investigators assigned the students with ADHD of class V from school
II as experimental group B and randomly provided for static cartoon-based intervention. Initially, the
researchers found 29 students diagnosed with ADHD, but due to some reasons (i.e. co-morbid
condition and poor internet connectivity), only 25 participants were selected and included in the
experimentation process. After selection of the participants, they were provided brief training on
static cartoon-based approach just before the actual teaching for acclimatisation with the subject
matters of Environmental Studies subject of class V by using Google Meet. The researchers prepared
static cartoon-based e-contents by following the contents and units that needed to teach.
Subsequently, the participants were pre-tested on achievement test and cognitive functioning test
using Google form for assessing their cognitive functioning ability and previous knowledge in
Environmental Studies. The static cartoon-based intervention was applied among the participants
for about 5 months, and after providing intervention, post-test was administered to assess their
performance in learning achievement in Environmental Studies and cognitive functioning abilities
and examine the impact of SCBI on these variables.
Stage 3: conventional method
In the similar way, a comparison group consisting of 25 students with ADHD of class V from school III
was selected and included in the present study. Later, the traditional method was used to teach the
participants about the contents prescribed in the textbook of class V in Environmental Studies
subject. Prior to actual teaching, pre-test on achievement test and cognitive functioning test was
administered to assess their current status. Accordingly, regular class practice was provided to
students with ADHD using Google Meet. After 20 weeks of instruction, again they were administered
post-test on the same test or questionnaire on the same participants to examine the efficacy of
traditional method on learning achievement and cognitive functioning abilities.
EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DIFFICULTIES 93
Materials and measures
ADHD diagnostic teacher’s rating scale
A standardised ADHD diagnostic teacher’s rating scale was used to screen the symptoms of ADHD in
student participants. This scale consisted of total of 18 statements with four response options:
0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = often and 3 = very often. Higher score indicates higher degree of
ADHD condition. The scale consisted of three dimensions: Inattentivity, Hyperactivity and
Impulsivity. The first eight statements indicate inattention symptoms and from 9 to 18 statements
show hyperactive and impulsive behaviour among the students. The researchers provided this scale
to the teachers who take classes in class V of three different schools to identify the ADHD behaviour
among students. The time required for responding to all the statements of scale was 15–20 minutes.
Likewise, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale and Conners’ Adult ADHD Ratings Scales are considered as
one of the best tools to examine and diagnose ADHD symptomatology especially among adults.
Achievement test in Environmental Studies subject
The researchers developed an achievement test in Environmental Studies subject which was especially meant for class V affiliated to CBSE board by following syllabus and all the standardised criteria
of test construction. Afterwards, the investigators discussed with the school administration, and
accordingly, the contents were selected, and following that, blueprint was prepared with proper
domain and weightage. The items of achievement test were included from the contents of
Environmental Studies subject consisted of super senses, A Snake Charmer’s story, From Tasting to
Digesting, Mangoes Round the Year, Seeds and Seeds, Every Drop Counts and Experiments with
Water. The test consisted of 50 MCQ items having a correct response, a strong distractor and two
wrong responses for assessing the learning achievement of students with ADHD in Environmental
Studies. After preparing the achievement test, it was sent to four experts for finding out content
validity ratio. During the standardisation process, the test–retest reliability (.88) and Cronbach’s
Alpha (.87) were estimated. The content validity ratio was determined and found to be (.81), and
the time required to respond to all the items was 15–20 minutes.
Cognitive functioning test
Cognitive functioning test is a test used to assess cognitive processes such thinking, attention,
perception, recognition, memory, retention, reasoning, decision making, visual and auditory processing of elementary children with ADHD age range from 11 to 12 years. The researchers developed
a cognitive functioning test comprising of two domains, measuring memory and reasoning. After
development and standardisation of the cognitive functioning test, it was administered to the
participants individually prior to the baseline phase of intervention. This test incorporated total of
20 items in the two domains of cognitive processes (memory and reasoning), most relevant to the
cognitive functioning of students with ADHD. Each item consisted of five options which assessed the
cognitive functioning capacity of students with ADHD. The content validity (.84) and reliability
coefficient (.88) of the test were estimated, and it needed maximum 20 minutes to response to all
items.
Statistical analyses
The investigators applied SPSS 21 version and AMOS 21 version for analysing the data and finding
out the outcome of ANCOVA. However, the correlation ship between the variables was done using
AMOS to find out the structural equation model which estimated χ2, NPAR, CMIN, NFI, CFI, PRATIO,
PCFI, NCP, FMIN, RMSEA, AIC, ECVI and HOELTER.

Results
The analysis was done to assess the relationship between static cartoon based instruction (SCBI) and
animated cartoon-based instruction (ACBI) with conventional method on the students diagnosed
with ADHD.
Table 1 shows the mean and standard error of the post-test score of dependent variables of the
investigation. The post-test mean and SD error of the SCBI group was M = 24.477 & SD error = 1.878,
animated cartoon-based instruction (ACBI) group was M = 32.357 & SD error = 1.878, and the
conventional learning group was M = 15.447 & SD error = 1.878. The mean of SCBI and ACBI was
much better than the conventional learning group. These findings were supported by Bamidele and
Yoade (2017), which resulted that computer animation instructional package helped in improving
academic achievement among students.
Table 2 shows the effects of SCBI group, ACBI group over the conventional groups on learning
performance in students with ADHD. The ANCOVA result reported using a univariate analysis test
and revealed a significant effect of SCBI and ACBI in the improvement of learning achievement and
cognitive functioning as compared to conventional approach on students after controlling the effect
of pre-test, F (1, 71) = .194, p = .661, and a significant difference was measured between the groups,
F (2, 71) = 20.302 which means p < 0.05, and the result was found to be significant to predict the
effect of the dependent variables. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis is accepted, and there
existed significant effects of SCBI and ACBI over conventional approach on learning achievement
of students with ADHD. However, the R squared score was .365 and adjusted R squared was .338.
These findings were supported by the outcome of several preset researches (Rapport et al. 2013; Roy,
Oldehinkel, and Hartman 2017) which revealed animation, ICT, cartoon, PowerPoint presentation,
virtual learning and computer-based instruction in improving academic achievement and cognitive
functioning of students with ADHD.

The cognitive functioning test includes two elements of development which are referred to as the
primary determinants for solving any problem and adjusting to society. The model CMIN
(NCPAR = 36, CMIN = 93.495, CMIN/DF = 1.731 is p < .05) and the baseline comparison (NFI = .268,

and 21, p < .05 of students with ADHD. Regarding the structural path, ACBA instruction positively
predicted memory (β = .48) and reasoning (β = −.23). Regarding the structural path, SCBA predicted
memory (β = −.06) and reasoning (β = .42). However, the structural path coefficient of conventional
approach negatively affects the memory (β = .01) and reasoning (β = −.13). It resulted that ACBA and
SCBA training for students with ADHD have a significantly positive relationship with the development of cognitive functioning and negative association with the comparison group (see Figure 1).
Finally, a significant relationship was recorded with memory and reasoning over the conventional
approach. The researchers assumed that the performance of ACBI and SCBI training with ADHD
students has a significant positive association with the improvement of cognitive functioning and
negative association with placebo or comparison group.
Discussion
This study aimed at examining whether animation-based instructional approach impacted learning
attainment in Environmental Studies for class V associated with cognitive processes of students who
were diagnosed with ADHD symptoms in elementary schools of Assam. The study was conducted
while there was nationwide partial and full lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic and all the
institutions including elementary schools were closed down. Consequently, the students, teachers
or other members involved with any educational institutions, etc., were not permitted to enter
school for face-to-face class. Therefore, the investigation was carried out on online mode in which
the subject matter was taught through animated cartoon-based e-content instruction and static
cartoon-based e-content instruction using Google Meet or Zoom application to the elementary

students with ADHD of treatment and placebo groups. However, for identifying and selecting the
students with ADHD ethical and medical guidelines were followed. Thereby, students with ADHD
symptoms of class V in three different elementary schools affiliated to CBSE board of Assam were
purposively selected for further investigation. Later on, three different interventions, i.e. static
cartoon-based approach, animation-based intervention and conventional method were randomly
assigned to the participants of three groups, namely Experimental group A, Experimental Group
B and comparison or placebo group. The observation and findings from the current experiment
indicated that ADHD condition in students tends to have more cognitive deficit, social difficulties
and poorer academic achievement as compared with non-ADHD students, and this result was
supported by (Jena and Devi 2020; Govindaraj 2017; Ryan et al. 2016; Rapport et al. 2013) in both
the treatment groups and comparison group. Collectively, they tend to struggle with sustaining
focus, planning, execution skills, critical thinking, problem solving and decision making which
increased the risk for academic performance and psychosocial problem (Jansen et al. 2017;
Weyandt et al. 2013). In contrast, the findings from the prior research showed that some children
with ADHD don’t show deficit in cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, working memory and
executive functions (Roy, Oldehinkel, and Hartman 2017), since at certain point they get matured
enough in cognitive domain. Similarly, researchers like Thissen et al. (2014) found from their
investigation that there was no significant relationship between cognitive development and academic achievement of children with ADHD. However, the present research claimed that both
animation and gag or static cartoon-based instructional treatment significantly influenced
Environmental Studies performance and cognitive functioning as compared with the conventional
method. Hence, the result of this study showed that their academic attainment and cognitive profile
were enhanced more among the participants of treatment groups than the placebo group. However,
we found some recent evidences that cognitive processes were closely associated with academic
achievement or underachievement in students who diagnosed with ADHD (Paucke, Stibbe, Huang, &
Strauss 2019; Thomaidis et al. 2017), and these findings contradict the result of their experiments
(Thissen et al. 2014). The outcome of this current experiment indicated that there was growth in
Environmental Studies learning attainment and intellectual development in students with ADHD
over 4 months of intervention, and this finding was supported by (Jena and Devi 2020; Andreou,
Riga, and Papayiannis 2016; Gkeka, Gougoudi, Mertsioti, and Drigas 2018; Aktas, Bulut, and Yuksel
2011). However, the performance of EVS learning achievement and cognitive processes was more
improved and better, while the participants were treated with animation cartoon-based instruction
followed by the static cartoon-based instrcution and traditional approach. Furthermore, on the basis
of the current investigation’s findings, we have come to the conclusion that if the students with
ADHD are taught with the application of animation or cartoon, not only their performance in
academic and cognitive profile improved but also a lively, interactive and joyful classroom session
can be created where students with their friends and teachers can have meaningful interaction.
Conclusion
During the lockdown period due to the COVID crisis, different approaches and interventions were
used by several teachers, researchers, educators, etc., for all levels of students including the students
who endorsed with ADHD symptoms. Animation, an important ICT tool, is used as an intervention in
the current study to examine its effect on performance in elementary students with ADHD. The
investigation resulted that animation-based instruction proved to be convenient and effective intervention for ADHD students with respect to their sex, age, caste, socio-economic condition, etc.
Moreover, it helped to enhance span of concentration, problem solving, thinking, reasoning, and
imagination capacity on the part of children having ADHD symptoms. Additionally, prior to other
research, it was found that students with ADHD are at risk of poor academic achievement, cognitive
processes, social development and interpersonal relationship (Shah et al. 2019). According to the
present study, the use of animation during the lockdown period due to COVID crisis was beneficial

especially for children having ADHD symptoms. This intervention helped to enhance academic
performance and improve their cognitive development, executive functions and reduced inattentive
behaviour. However, the current research also revealed that the lockdown situation led to worsening
the ADHD behaviour, attention, hyper activeness and concentration level, which negatively impacted
their academic performance, cognitive processes, emotional tantrum and social interrelationship with
their peers than the pre-COVID situation which require a new intervention. Even though this research
found some limitations of the study, viz. developing animation-based e-contents, training to use the
animation by the teachers, the cost for setting up of smart classroom, cost of internet connectivity,
irregular power supply. But it also resulted that animation-based e-content approach helped not only
the students with ADHD but also the teachers who deal with these students and teach the contents to
them regularly. In such way, both students and teachers get benefitted by the application of
animation-based instruction especially in elementary school level. However, the current study suggested that ‘animation’-based intervention was useful in dealing with the problems of poor academic
performance and deficit in cognitive functioning abilities among elementary students with ADHD as
compared to the static cartoon and conventional approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
very first study which examined efficacy of animation-based intervention on learning attainment in
Environmental Studies and its interrelation with the cognitive functioning of elementary students
diagnosed with ADHD in Assam, India, especially while there was nationwide lockdown situation.
However, the findings of the present study have essential implication for practice as well as for
future research. The participants can largely be benefitted by the application of a novel intervention
i.e. animation to address their challenge of sustaining attention which helped to attain greatest
academic knowledge and skills. The findings revealed that students with ADHD benefitted most
from the animated cartoon approach than the static cartoon instruction and conventional method.
Nevertheless, the students with ADHD performed better while exposed to animated and static
cartoon-based instructional strategy over the traditional method. Thus, the teacher should be
encouraged to teach the elementary students with ADHD through animation-based instruction as
much as possible. The findings of the study have great implications for educators in the field of
educational psychology as well as developer of animated and gag cartoon. However, the animation
or cartoon-based materials, i.e. videos, images, pictures, etc., are easily accessible on online; therefore, the concerned teacher can download them and apply them while teaching these students.
Besides these, this study also proved that animationand cartoon has significant positive impact on
the cognitive aspect and performance among the participants, which implies that animation helps to
enhance their cognitive function and academic performance. Since this, experimentation
supports the application of animation in the field of education; therefore, it encourages several
distinguished educators, psychologists and prominent educational institutions to develop modules
on animation or to create animated videos related to the different school subjects, which should be
easily accessible on many web portals from where the students as well as teachers can download
and use it whenever necessary. With reference to these ideologies, the National Curriculum
Framework 2005 and National Education Policy 2020 have also emphasised on the ICT-based
Instruction for all children at all different levels of education. Additionally, the authors suggested
that teachers, researchers, parents and experts who are actually dealing with ADHD students should
apply this animation video or module for the enhancement of learning attainment and cognitive
development. Therefore, the policy makers, curriculum framers and researchers should take some
advantages through the module by introducing it in educational setting so that maximum number
of students gets benefitted.
