      <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
      <p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">From Inside The Cave...</span></p>

      <p>When the people walk into the cave, at first, they don’t see anything. They think they are alone, with nothing to see except the blank walls around them. As they continue to walk deeper into the cave <span class="clickable" id="first-change"> a shadow suddenly appears</span>, catching their attention and startling them. From their perspective, all they can see is a line. Coming into their line of sight and then leaving. They think that each time the shadow appears, a new one has been created. Since it comes into and out of the frame, rather than the people thinking it’s one shadow moving, they think that each time the shadow leaves, it dies, and a new one is created. When the people turn the corner, they see that the line they previously saw <span class="clickable" id="second-change"> is a ring</span>. Is this a shadow of a door to somewhere? The people continue to walk towards the shadow, but as they walk closer, the farther away the shadow goes. When they walk backward, the closer it gets. Never able to reach it. </p>

      <p>Nick Sousani defines Flatness as a form of conformity, with a one-dimensional perspective to thought and behaviour. Where the individual is taken away, and all decisions are predefined. It fails to account for the complexities of reality, basing all decisions on the ideal. There is no room for individual creativity or perspectives, keeping a narrow-minded focus. The concept of flatness makes me think of a doll factory, where each doll is created for a specific purpose and to provide the most profit. Flatness is a world where the individual is gone, and people are left fulfilling their duties and checking off boxes. The people in the cave have a very narrow perspective on what they are experiencing. Rather than looking to find more answers, they make fast judgments based on little information. Thinking that a new shadow is created every time it comes into sight shows a failure to explore multiple perspectives. Additionally, through the difficulties of trying to reach the shadow, continuing the same way of trying also supports the concept of Flatness. If they take a second and explore alternative explanations, they might uncover new ideas rather than trying to reach something unreachable. The people in the cave take the first answer they find and stick to that perspective. This often leads to a misunderstanding, which is shown after they realize that the shadow is never new. Believing the first answer is not always the best option for understanding situations. </p>

      <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
      <p><span class="clickable" id="part-two"> Outside The Cave...</span></p>

      <p>Without reaching the shadow, the people gave up and made their way out of the cave. When they reached the exit, they were blinded by a massive UFO shining its bright light into the cave, with a small ring-shaped ship in front, moving to and from the cave entrance, making a shadow. As soon as the people left the cave, <span class="clickable" id="third-change">a huge spike</span>  fell from the sky in an attempt to land on the little ship, trying to kill it. The spike continued to hover over the ground and track the little ship. The people learned that the UFO sent the little ship to inspect the cave to see if it was a safe place for their species to live, as they were searching for safety. The shadow kept going forward and back because the little ship would go into the cave further as the people walked in more, but when the people backed up, the UFO also backed up, causing the changes in the size of the shadow. The small ship was moving fast because it was in a rush to find safety out of fear for a competing species, who sent the spike to kill. The people then witnessed the spike that fell from the sky levitate and <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">turn upside down</span>,  turning into a sword, impaling the little ship and killing it.</p>

      <p>Nick Sousani’s concept of Seeing Double explores the power of embracing multiple perspectives and the new opportunities they create. This concept emphasizes how shifting viewpoints can lead to deeper understanding and more innovative solutions. Seeing beyond a single viewpoint and acknowledging diverse perspectives can help to create a richer understanding. Moving away from a one-dimensional framework to looking through different angles, searching for multiple interpretations and searching for a deeper understanding. The light from the UFO shining in the cave caused the people inside the cave to think that there was a door or some type of object inside the cave, and that is all that they could see from the inside. Not realizing that a UFO is trying to bring the end of the world and kill other ships on our planet by dropping spikes outside. Through a flat perspective, the people thought it was a “door” on the inside, but when going outside and seeking further explanation, they learned it was a deathly UFO. On the inside of the cave, from their single perspective, everything seems one way, but beyond life in the cave, there are many more dangerous things happening.</p>
